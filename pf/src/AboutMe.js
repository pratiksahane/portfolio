    <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate developer who loves building web and mobile applications. Whether it's designing a sleek user interface or writing clean backend logic, I enjoy crafting digital experiences that are useful and impactful.
    Currently, I'm exploring technologies like React, Node.js, and Android development. I believe in continuous learning and love taking on new challenges to grow my skill set.
    When I'm not coding, you can find me learning new tools, working on side projects, or exploring tech communities. Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
